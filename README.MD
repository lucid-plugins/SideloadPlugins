# Lucid Plugins

This fork of Lucid Plugins are plugins made for the EthanVann API (see info below) and are either plugins made by
me or were outdated plugins that I ported and updated.
I am currently working on maintaining an updated version of each of my plugins to support both the Devious Client API (https://github.com/jbx5/devious-client)
and the EthanVann API (https://github.com/Ethan-Vann/EthanVannPlugins)

**If a plugin is not originally by me it will not have "Lucid" in the plugin name**
